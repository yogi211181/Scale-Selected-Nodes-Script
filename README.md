# Scale-Selected-Nodes-Script
This script is useful for organizing node layouts dynamically while maintaining relative spacing.

Short Description:
Scale Selected Nodes Script

This script allows you to scale the positions of selected nodes in Nuke relative to the center of the selection. By specifying a scaling factor:

Scaling up (e.g., 1.5) spreads the nodes farther apart from the center.
Scaling down (e.g., 0.5) moves the nodes closer to the center.
Key Features:

Automatically calculates the geometric center of the selected nodes.
Adjusts node positions proportionally based on the scaling factor.
Prompts for a scaling factor input (e.g., 1.0, 0.5, 2.0).
Usage:

Select the nodes you want to scale.
Run the script via the menu or Ctrl+Shift+S.
Enter a scaling factor when prompted.
